# Web Development Project 6 - BrewDash

Submitted by: **Hotragn Pettugani**

This web app: **BrewDash is a comprehensive brewery dashboard that allows users to explore and discover breweries across the United States. It fetches data from the Open Brewery DB API and provides an interactive, visually appealing dashboard with dynamic filters, search functionality, individual detail views, and visual insights via charts.**

Time spent: **7.5 hours** spent in total

## Notes

### Challenges Encountered:
- Managing multiple dynamic filters with React state
- Implementing dynamic routing with React Router
- Ensuring responsive and accessible layout across screen sizes

### Solutions:
- Used `useEffect` with dependencies to track real-time updates
- Set up dynamic routing for detail views using `react-router-dom`
- Leveraged Material-UI and custom CSS media queries for responsiveness
